# Using Cloud Storage

Shoutem Cloud Storage is a CMS solution for mobile apps. We made the [@shoutem/redux-io](https://github.com/shoutem/redux-io) package to simplify the communication with Shoutem CMS. Define a `data schema` to describe your data model, do this in your Restaurant extension directory:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem schema add Restaurants
Schema `Restaurants` is created in file `server/data-schemas/Restaurants.json`!
File `extension.json` was modified.
```

The CLI just created a `data-schemas` folder inside the `server` folder and put `Restaurants.json` in it, which contains the following:

```JSON
#file: server/data-schemas/Restaurants.json
{
  "title": "Restaurants",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "format": "single-line",
      "title": "Name",
      "type": "string",
      "displayPriority": 1
    },
  },
  "titleProperty": "name",
  "type": "object"
}
```

We're using the `server` folder because data schemas are not part of the app code, but rather the server side of an extension. Data schemas are nothing more than Shoutem-flavored [JSON Schemas](http://json-schema.org/). They describe the data being stored on Shoutem Cloud Storage.

All fields are explained in the [data schema reference]({{ site.url }}/docs/cloud/data-schemas). This schema is exported in `extension.json`:

```JSON{18-21}
#file: extension.json
{
  "name": "restaurants",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "platform": "1.0.*",
  "title": "Restaurants",
  "description": "A restaurants extension.",
  "screens": [{
    "name": "List"
  }, {
    "name": "Details"
  }],
  "shortcuts": [{
    "name": "Restaurants",
    "title": "Restaurants",
    "description": "Allow users to browse through list of restaurants"
    "screen": "@.List",
  }],
  "dataSchemas": [{
    "name": "Restaurants",
    "path": "server/data-schemas/Restaurants.json"
  }]
}
```

Currently, your schema only has the `name` property, which we'll use for each restaurants name. Let's add additional properties which we want to have for each restaurant, such as: `address`, `description`, website `url`, `image` and `mail`.

```JSON{4-40}
#file: server/data-schemas/Restaurants.json
{
  "title": "Restaurant",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "format": "single-line",
      "title": "Restaurant's name",
      "type": "string",
      "displayPriority": 1
    },
    "address": {
      "format": "single-line",
      "title": "Address",
      "type": "string",
      "displayPriority": 2
    },
    "description": {
      "format": "multi-line",
      "title": "Description",
      "type": "string",
      "displayPriority": 3
    },
    "url": {
      "format": "uri",
      "title": "Website",
      "type": "string",
      "displayPriority": 4
    },
    "image": {
      "format": "attachment",
      "title": "Image",
      "type": "object",
      "referencedSchema": "shoutem.core.image-attachments",
      "displayPriority": 5
    },
    "mail": {
      "format": "single-line",
      "title": "E-mail",
      "type": "string",
      "displayPriority": 6
    }
  },
  "titleProperty": "name",
  "type": "object"
}
```

To enter data for your schema, you need to use settings page. Basically, the [settings pages]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/settings-pages-introduction) are web pages on the Builder. Extension developers write them to enable app owners to manage their extensions.

Shoutem prepared a CMS settings page inside the [shoutem.cms](https://github.com/shoutem/extensions/tree/master/shoutem-cms) extension that you can use to manage data for your `schema` on the Shoutem Cloud. Reference that settings page in the `Restaurants` shortcut and pass it the `Restaurants` schema. The page will appear when an app owner selects the `Restaurants` shortcut on the Builder:

```JSON{17-23}
#file: extension.json
{
  "name": "restaurants",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "platform": "1.0.*",
  "title": "Restaurants",
  "description": "List of restaurants",
  "screens": [{
    "name": "List"
  }, {
    "name": "Details"
  }],
  "shortcuts": [{
    "name": "Restaurants",
    "title": "Restaurants",
    "description": "Allow users to browse through list of restaurants",
    "screen": "@.List",
    "adminPages": [{
      "page": "shoutem.cms.CmsPage",
      "title": "Content",
      "parameters": {
        "schema": "@.Restaurants"
      }
    }]
  }],
  "dataSchemas": [{
    "name": "Restaurants",
    "path": "server/data-schemas/Restaurants.json"
  }]
}
```

Let's upload the extension now, since we want to customize the web interface and the extension server side:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem push
Uploading `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Success!
```

Go to the [Builder]({{ shoutem.builderURL }}), open your app and select `Restaurants` under `Main navigation` to see the Shoutem CMS page.

<p class="image">
<img alt='Shoutem interface Restaurants tab' src='{{ site.url }}/img/my-first-extension/empty-cms-page.png'/>
</p>

Click on `Create Items` to start adding content. This will open a modal that contains the `CMS` interface, where you can manage the content for your extension. Apps that get content from the Shoutem CMS will immediately show new content once you edit or add it.

<p class="image">
<img alt='Restaurants tab with Add Item button' src='{{ site.url }}/img/my-first-extension/empty-cms.png'/>
</p>

Click on `Add item`. This will open a modal for inserting data for the `Restaurants` model, which you defined with your data schema.

<p class="image">
<img alt='Shoutem interface New Item form' src='{{ site.url }}/img/my-first-extension/cms-modal.png'/>
</p>

Add at least one restaurant. Now you can see the data in the CMS settings page of your Restaurants extension:

<p class="image">
<img alt='Shoutem interface Restaurants tab containing list of restaurant data' src='{{ site.url }}/img/my-first-extension/full-cms.png'/>
</p>

Although you've added some restaurants in the Builder, your extension is still coded to use static data from the `assets` folder you set up earlier in the tutorial series. Let's change that and start fetching the data from Shoutem Cloud Storage using the `@shoutem/redux-io` package.
