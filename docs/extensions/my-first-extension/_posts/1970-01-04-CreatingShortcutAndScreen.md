# Creating a Screen and Shortcut

Extensions can have multiple screens in the app. Screens are [React components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html) that represent a mobile screen. We want our Restaurants extension to have 2 screens; one for the list of the restaurants (which we already made in [Getting Started]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/getting-started)) and another for the details of each particular restaurant the user taps.

Since the app needs to know which screen to open first for some extension, we need to create a ***shortcut*** when creating that screen. A shortcut is a link to the starting screen of an extension. It's the item in the Main Navigation which opens the starting screen when a user taps on it.

We created the List screen with a shortcut in [Getting Started]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/getting-started) using:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem screen add List
? Screen name: List
? Create a shortcut (so that screen can be added through the Builder)? Yes
? Shortcut name: {{ site.example.extensionName }}
? Shortcut title: Restaurants
? Shortcut description: A shortcut for List
...
Success
```

The CLI modified the `extension.json` to include the screen and it's shortcut:

```json{7-14}
#file: extension.json
{
  "name": "restaurants",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "platform": "1.0.*",
  "title": "Restaurants",
  "description": "List of restaurants",
  "screens": [{
    "name": "List"
  }],
  "shortcuts": [{
    "name": "Restaurants",
    "title": "Restaurants"
    "screen": "@.List"
  }]
}
```

They were added inside arrays. The `name` property uniquely identifies these extension parts. A shortcut's `title` is what will be shown in the Main Navigation (in the Builder and in the app). The `screen` property inside `shortcuts` references the screen that will open when a user taps on that shortcut in navigation.

When referencing any extension part, we need to say which extension it came from. The full name of extension part follows this structure: `<developer-name>.<extension-name>.<extension-part-name>` (e.g. `{{ site.example.devName }}.restaurants.List)`. For extension parts within the same extension, you can just use `@.<extension-part-name>` (e.g. `@.List`). `@.` stands for `<developer-name>.<extension-name>.` of the current extension.

The Shoutem CLI also created `app/screens/` folder with a `List.js` file, which you edited in [Getting Started]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/getting-started).

## How do Extensions fit into an App?

The `app` folder from your extension will be bundled (along with the rest of the extensions your app uses) into the full React Native app. For your extension to use an `npm` package, just install it inside the `app` folder.

Below is an example of installing [React Native swiper](https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper) (just an example, no need to execute following 2 commands).

Locate to the `app` folder and install the package with saving the dependency in the `package.json`:

```ShellSession
$ cd app/
$ npm install --save react-native-swiper
```

This package would be installed when bundling your extension into the app. You would be able to access it in any file in the `app` folder.

## Exporting Extension Parts

The app expects extensions to export their parts (e.g. screens) in `app/index.js` (that's standard JS practice). Extensions are like libraries and other extensions can reuse what they export from `app/index.js`. The convention is that `app/index.js` is the public API of an extension and shouldn't be changed often.

The current `index.js` looks like this:

```JSX
#file: app/index.js
// Reference for app/index.js can be found here:
// http://shoutem.github.io/docs/extensions/reference/extension-exports

import * as extension from './extension.js';

export const screens = extension.screens;

export const themes = extension.themes;
```

On the other hand, `app/extension.js` is managed by the CLI and you should not change it. When creating screens, the CLI writes their location in `app/extension.js` which are exported in `app/index.js`.

## Previewing Extension Code Changes

We already did this in [Getting Started]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/getting-started), but let's elaborate on it. Since the app is managed through the Builder, we needed to `push` the extension to Shoutem and `install` it into our app so we can use and preview it in the Builder.

We then opened the app in the Builder and added the extension's screen to Main navigation. Installing new extensions and adding their shortcuts to the app requires you to reconfigure your local clone, which we also did using `shoutem configure`.

Let's preview your app again. We can preview it in the Builder, but it might take some time while the Builder bundles the entire app again. Every time you change an extension, you'd have to _push_ it again and then the Builder would need to re-bundle the whole app to add the changes. It's much faster to [set up your local environment]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/setting-local-environment) and simply use `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`.

Let's preview the app and see where we stopped in [Getting Started]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/getting-started).

```ShellSession
$ react-native run-ios
Scanning folders for symlinks in /path/to/Restaurants/node_modules
...
```

<p class="image">
<img alt="Phone showing Let's Eat text" src='{{ site.url }}/img/tutorials/getting-started/03-lets-eat.png'/>
</p>

> #### Note
> In the documentation the preview you see is from the Builder, instead of a screenshot from the Shoutem Preview app or a local emulator. This way you'll see the state of the web interface as well.

Now let's make a quick change to the app code so you can see it change in real time on the emulator. Open your `restaurants` extension's `List.js` screen file and add another line of text:

```JavaScript{6}
#file: app/screens/List.js
export default class List extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Let's eat!</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Can't do anything on an empty stomach!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

After reloading the emulator, your new line of text should be visible immediately:

<p class="image">
<img alt="Phone showing Let's Eat, Can't do anything on an empty stomach" src='{{ site.url }}/img/my-first-extension/real-time-preview.png'/>
</p>

Your extension only has a simple screen right now, let's add some [UI components]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/my-first-extension/using-ui-toolkit).
