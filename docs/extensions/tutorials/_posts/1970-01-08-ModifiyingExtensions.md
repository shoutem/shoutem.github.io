# Modifying Extensions

Shoutem's mission is simple - **do not solve problems that have already been solved**. Quite often apps that we build need common features you've seen numerous times: push notifications, analytics, ads, authentication, RSS readers, eCommerce integrations and so on. This is what extensions are for - just reuse pre-built features.

However, for the app to succeed, it needs to be **unique**. Recreating an RSS reader just to make it unique is redundant work. Sometimes, it's enough to customize your app in the dashboard, customize the theme, or [write a new theme]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/writing-a-theme), but sometimes we need to modify the currently available extensions.

There are two ways to achieve this:

- 1) Directly modify the extension code - the resulting new extension will **not** get future updates that the original extension gets
- 2) Extend the extension - new extension will get future updates from the original extension

Both methods result in a brand new extension. (Yes, even when you _extend_ an extension)

## 1) Directly Modify the Extension Code

Since all Shoutem extensions are [open sourced](https://github.com/shoutem/extensions), you can directly take the code of an extension, modify it and _push_ it as your own extension to Shoutem.

For the purpose of this demo, create a new blank app and add a **News RSS** screen inside of the navigation. In the **Content** section, enter a link to an RSS feed (e.g. https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/breaking_news.rss). In the **Layout** section, select `List` as the default layout.

This is what it should look like (images and text vary with RSS feed):

<p class="image">
<img alt='Screens layout page' src='{{ site.url }}/img/tutorials/modifying-extensions/provided-layouts.png'/>
</p>

You do want list layout, but with large images in `Tiles`, such as the ones provided in the [UI toolkit]({{ site.url }}/docs/ui-toolkit/components/tiles). So let's modify News RSS extension directly to get those large images.

Download the [News RSS extension](https://github.com/shoutem/extensions/tree/master/shoutem-rss-news) from the repository and navigate to the extension's folder:

```ShellSession
$ cd shoutem.rss-news
```

Check the `renderRow` method in `app/screens/ArticlesListScreen.js`:

```javascript
#file: app/screens/ArticlesListScreen.js
  renderRow(article) {
    return (
      <ListArticleView
        key={article.id}
        articleId={article.id}
        title={article.title}
        imageUrl={getLeadImageUrl(article)}
        date={article.timeUpdated}
        onPress={this.openArticleWithId}
      />
    );
  }
```

It uses the `ListArticleView` component. Customize the `render` method in that component to use `Tiles` and don't forget to import additional components from the `@shoutem/ui`. This is the complete code you should end up with:

```JSX{7-8,24,27-30}
#file: app/components/ListArticleView.js
import React from 'react';
import moment from 'moment';

import {
  TouchableOpacity,
  Caption,
  ImageBackground,
  Tile,
  Title
} from '@shoutem/ui';

import { ListArticleView } from 'shoutem.news/components/ListArticleView';
import { getLeadImageUrl } from 'shoutem.rss';

export class ListArticleView extends ArticleView {
  render() {
    const { article } = this.props;
    const dateFormat = moment(article.timeUpdated).isBefore(0) ?
    null : (<Caption>{moment(article.timeUpdated).fromNow()}</Caption>);

    return (
      <TouchableOpacity key={article.id} onPress={this.onPress}>
        <ImageBackground
          styleName="featured"
          source={% raw %}{{{% endraw %} uri: getLeadImageUrl(article) }}
        >
          <Tile>
            <Title styleName="md-gutter-bottom">{article.title}</Title>
            {dateFormat}
          </Tile>
        </ImageBackground>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    );
  }
}
```

And that's it! Save it and push it to Shoutem:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem push
Uploading `News RSS` extension to Shoutem...
Success!
```

Install it on your app either through the [Builder]({{ site.shoutem.builderURL }})  or with:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem install
Select app to install extension: News App
Success!
```

Delete the old News RSS screen from the navigation (click on the `...` in the top right corner and select **Delete**), insert the new `News RSS` screen from the `Custom` category, set up your RSS feed in the **Content** tab and select the `List` layout from the **Layout** tab.

This is what you should get (images and text vary with RSS feed):

<p class="image">
<img alt='Screens layout page' src='{{ site.url }}/img/tutorials/modifying-extensions/customized-list-layout.png'/>
</p>

This is what we wanted! It was quite easy and straightforward. However, doing this means creating a completely separate extension which won't get any updates done by Shoutem on Shoutem's **News RSS** extension.

To get those updates from Shoutem, we want to extend the extension instead of changing its code directly.

### Debugging directly edited extensions

When directly editing Shoutem extensions you will have to either re-clone the app after uploading and installing the extension into your app or re-naming the extension's directory name locally, otherwise you might experience issues on the Builder.

> #### Note
> When forking (directly editing) Shoutem's extensions, you should re-clone the app after uploading and installing the extension to keep everything in sync.

For example, you decide to modify the News extension and install it to your app, then uninstall `shoutem.news` so you only have your News extension installed, `{{ site.example.devName }}.news`. This will cause issues with `shoutem.rss-news` because it imports components from `shoutem.news` in multiple places:

```javascript
#file: shoutem.rss-news/app/ArticlesGridScreen.js
import { FeaturedArticleView, GridArticleView } from 'shoutem.news';
```

In the described situation, the Builder preview will fail, but locally your app will function as intended. This is because your local extension directory for `{{ site.example.devName }}.news` is still called `shoutem.news`, while the Builder only has `{{ site.example.devName }}.news`. In order to catch these sorts of issues locally, you will have to either rename the extension directory or re-clone the app.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem clone --dir "Fresh Clone"
```

## 2) Extend the extension

Extending an extension is the preferred way of modifying extensions.

##### When to do it?

For bigger modifications, such as changing the data schema being used, it's not possible to modify functionality without directly modifying the extension. Extending extensions is usually done for writing screen layouts, extending components (overwriting contents) and such.

##### How to do it?

[Here](https://github.com/shoutem/extension-examples/tree/master/tom.extending-extension) is the open sourced extension as the final result of this chapter. Let's create a new extension:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem init news-rss
...
Extension initialized!
```

Switch over to the newly made directory:

```ShellSession
$ cd {{ site.example.devName }}.news-rss
```

Create a new screen which will extend the List screen from the original Shoutem **News RSS** extension:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem screen add ListWithBigPictures
? Screen name: ListWithBigPictures
? Create a shortcut (so that screen can be added through the Builder)? No
Success
```

Now we need to say which screen our `ListWithBigPictures` screen extends. Do this in `extension.json` in the `extends` field:

```JSON{9-11}
#file: extension.json
{
  "name": "news-rss",
  "title": "My news RSS",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "",
  "platform": "1.*.*",
  "screens": [{
    "name": "ListWithBigPictures",
    "title": "List with big pictures",
    "image": "./server/assets/large-news-list.png",
    "extends": "shoutem.rss-news.ArticlesGridScreen"
  }]
}
```

We extended `ArticlesGridScreen` from Shoutem's **News RSS** extension, since it's the [original screen](https://github.com/shoutem/extensions/blob/master/shoutem-rss-news/extension.json#L29). We've also added a `title` and `image` which will both be shown in the layout selector. Download the image [here]({{ site.url }}/static/modifying-extension/assets.zip), extract it and paste the `assets` folder into the extension's `server` folder.

> #### Note
> If you can't remember the fields in `extension.json`, all of them are documented in the [reference]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/reference/extension).

Let's implement our `ListWithBigPictures` screen. In `extension.json`, we are extending `ArticlesGridScreen`, but that's only for the layout selector. In the implementation, we actually want to extend the `ArticlesListScreen`. Why? Because  `ArticlesListScreen` renders the `ListArticleView` component from Shoutem **News**.

When overriding that method, we could immediately implement the `ListArticleView` functionality inside. However, since we want to get Shoutem's updates for the `ListArticleView` component too, we'll create a new component extending that one and use it in the overridden `renderRow` function.

Create the `components` folder and a component file inside:

```ShellSession
$ mkdir app/components
$ touch app/components/BigPictureView.js
```

Implement the `BigPictureView` component:

```javascript
#file: app/components/BigPictureView.js
import React from 'react';
import moment from 'moment';

import {
  TouchableOpacity,
  Caption,
  ImageBackground,
  Tile,
  Title,
} from '@shoutem/ui';

import { ListArticleView } from 'shoutem.news/components/ListArticleView';
import { getLeadImageUrl } from 'shoutem.rss';

const resolveDateCaption = (article) => (
  moment(article.timeUpdated).isBefore(0) ? null :
  <Caption>{moment(article.timeUpdated).fromNow()}</Caption>
);

export class BigPictureView extends ListArticleView {
  render() {
    const { article } = this.props;
    const dateFormat = resolveDateCaption(article);

    return (
      <TouchableOpacity key={article.id} onPress={this.onPress}>
        <ImageBackground
          styleName="featured"
          source={% raw %}{{{% endraw %} uri: getLeadImageUrl(article) }}
        >
          <Tile>
            <Title styleName="md-gutter-bottom">{article.title}</Title>
            {dateFormat}
          </Tile>
        </ImageBackground>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    );
  }
}
```

We're importing `ListArticleView` from the `shoutem.news` extension, since the `app` folder is bundled into the overall app.

We've implemented the new `render` function and deleted everything we didn't need to override from the `ListArticleView` component.

Now, let's override the `renderRow` method in the `ListWithBigPictures` screen:

```javascript
#file: app/screens/ListWithBigPictures.js
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { connectStyle } from '@shoutem/theme';

import {
  ArticlesListScreen,
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps,
} from 'shoutem.rss-news/screens/ArticlesListScreen';

import { BigPictureView } from '../components/BigPictureView';
import { ext } from '../const';

export class ListWithBigPictures extends ArticlesListScreen {
  renderRow(article) {
    return (
      <BigPictureView
        article={article}
        onPress={this.openArticleWithId}
        articleId={article.id}
      />
    );
  }
}

// since the original screen is connected to redux state,
// we have to reconnect it in our screen too
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(
  connectStyle(ext('ListWithBigPictures'))(ListWithBigPictures),
);
```

And we're done! Push the extension to Shoutem.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem push
Uploading `My news RSS` extension to Shoutem...
Success!
```

Install it to a new blank app:

```ShellSession
shoutem install --new "News App"
...
```

Open your new app in the Builder. Now, add a screen from the **Shoutem** News RSS extension. Why that one? Because in our new extension, we only extended a screen and didn't create a new shortcut, so we couldn't add it's screen even if we wanted to! However, since both **News RSS** and **My news RSS** are installed in the app, the layout selector will recognize the new `List with big pictures` layout from **My news RSS** and show it in the layout list of Shoutem's **News RSS**.

Add an RSS feed in the **Content** tab, select the new layout in the **Layout** tab and run the app. This is what you should get (images and text vary with RSS feed):

<p class="image">
<img alt='Screens layout page' src='{{ site.url }}/img/tutorials/modifying-extensions/new-layout.png'/>
</p>

This way, we only extended Shoutem's **News RSS** extension and our extension will automatically get the all updates from Shoutem.
