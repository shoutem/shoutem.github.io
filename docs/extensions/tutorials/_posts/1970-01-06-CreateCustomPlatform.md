# Creating a custom platform

## Why a custom platform?

As the needs of your project grow, they might extend beyond of what the default Shoutem platform offers.

In case you need to add another Native dependency to your project, or use a custom Android or iOS configuration, or anything else not covered in the ["Modifying Native Project" tutorial](https://shoutem.github.io/docs/extensions/tutorials/modifying-native-project) - you can do it by creating a custom platform for your project.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install the [Shoutem CLI](https://shoutem.github.io/docs/extensions/reference/cli), and [create a Shoutem developer account](https://builder.shoutem.com/register).

Once you've done that, you can continue by reading about the [platform-related CLI commands](https://shoutem.github.io/docs/extensions/reference/cli#shoutem-platform-create---url).

If you need help or you need more information about custom platforms, you can contact us via our [main website](https://new.shoutem.com/about/contact-us/).
