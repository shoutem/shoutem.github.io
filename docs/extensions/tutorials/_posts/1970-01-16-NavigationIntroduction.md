# Navigation

With the platform update 3.0.0, weâ€™ve made some significant changes to the navigation extension. Main motivation behind this extension overhaul was mostly performance related, but it is also supposed to allow for easier extension development for both Shoutem in-house team, and the 3rd party developers, going forward.

Due to the scope of the changes we needed to implement, there are some breaking changes that 3rd party developers will need to take into account when upgrading their extensions to support the new platform.

You can continue reading about changes and improvements in the [following pages]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/navigation-breaking-changes), where we will dive deeper into main differences between the old platform and suggest best practices with updating your current custom extension versions.
